\title{Calculate oxygen saturation concentration and percent saturation at depth}
\usage{
oxygen_saturation(
  temp,
  do_measured,
  salinity = 35,
  depth = 0,
  atm_pressure = 1013.25
)
}
\arguments{
\item{temp}{Temperature in degrees Celsius (numeric or vector).}

\item{do_measured}{Measured dissolved oxygen in mg/L (numeric or vector).}

\item{salinity}{Salinity in psu (default: 35 for Mazatlan seawater, numeric or vector).}

\item{depth}{Depth in meters (default: 0 for sea level, numeric or vector).}

\item{atm_pressure}{Atmospheric pressure in hPa (default: 1013.25 for sea level).}
}
\value{
A data frame with saturation concentration (mg/L) and percent saturation.
}
\description{
Computes oxygen saturation concentration (mg/L) using the Weiss (1970) formula,
adjusted for pressure at depth, and percent saturation based on measured dissolved
oxygen, temperature, salinity, and depth. Assumes sea level atmospheric pressure
(1013.25 hPa) unless specified.
